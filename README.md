Welcome to Term 1! We'll start off by installing and setting up some essential applications. This process may differ based on your operating system.

## Step 1: Set up your command line

#### For MacOS

If you're using a Mac, congrats! You have it easy. Your command line application is already installed. It's called Terminal.

Locate this application by going to your Applications folder, then going to the Utilities folder inside. Terminal should be inside of there.

Alternatively, you can press `[CMD][SPACE]` to bring up MacOS's Spotlight Search inside of which you can search for "Terminal".

#### For Windows 

Cmder: https://cmder.app/

## Step 2: Install VSCode

Download an install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## Step 3: Create a GitHub Account

Go to https://github.com/ and create a new account with your personal email address. If you have a GitHub account already you can use that instead.

Add a profile picture to your account.

Over time, your GitHub account will grow into a public portfolio of your coding work.

## Step 4: Set up Slack

* Download the Slack application (https://slack.com/downloads)
* Use your Code Immersives email to join our Slack group https://join.slack.com/t/slack-2w22859/shared_invite/zt-1nrv8frxf-Mibv9g0lcpCeUq0Yc0o~XA
* Add a profile picture to your Slack account
* Send a direct message to the instructor and TAs (a single group message)

## Step 5: Turn in this assignment on Populi

To turn in this assignment, take a single screenshot that shows all of the following:
* VSCode running
* Slack running
* A webpage displaying your GitHub account

Turn this screenshot in at the Populi assignment labelled "Getting Started".
