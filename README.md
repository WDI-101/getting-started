# Getting started!

Welcome to Term 1. We'll start off by installing and setting up some essential applications.

## The command line

#### For OSX (Mac)

Congratulations, you have it easy, you're command line application is already installed. It's called Terminal.

Locate this application by going to your Applications folder, then going to the Utilities folder inside. Terminal should be inside of there.

Alternatively, you can press `[CMD][SPACE]` to bring up OSX's Spotlight Search inside of which you can search for "Terminal".

#### For Windows 

Windows users have it a bit harder when it comes to installing your command line application. You'll need to follow the "Manual Installation Instructions" here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps

This is a bit in the weeds and the instructions use lot of lingo so please don't hesitate to reach out to Alex to jump in a meeting to walk through these instructions together.

## Create a GitHub Account

Go to https://github.com/ and create a new account with your personal email address. If you have a GitHub account already you can use that instead.

Add a profile picture to your account.

Over time, your GitHub account will grow into a public portfolio of your coding work.
